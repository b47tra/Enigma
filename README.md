# Enigma
Script for digital representation of the famous Enigma. It replicates how actual Enigma worked with plugs, rotors and reflectors.

Firstly you can select between multiple rotors and plug combinations. The rotors given are just randomly scrambled alphabet, you can make your own or use the real rotors used in Enigma.

You can add some other reflector if you want. I just used the inverted alphabet.

Function's arguments are text you want to cipher, 3 rotors, notches of the first 2 rotors(rightmost and middle), and their starting positions.

Enigma's symmetrical so if you inputed string A and got B as output, if you input that string B you will get A again, of course only if you use same settings.

Here's reference that i used to write this and to help you understand the code if you want to change it somehow: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybkkiGtJmkM&list=LL&index=7&t=5s.
